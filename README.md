# NeapolitanCanon public dataset
## Description
The dataset "NeapolitanCanon" contains transcriptions of selected historical catalogues of the library of the Conservatoire of Naples, created under the direction of the first archivist, Giuseppe Sigismondo (1739-1826), and compares them with the documents kept there today. 
It was produced within the project [Creating the Neapolitan Canon](https://www.hkb-interpretation.ch/projekte/creating-the-neapolitan-canon) and published on a [dedicated website](https://neapolitancanon.hkb.bfh.ch/) in 2021.
It comprises at present:
- the 1801 printed catalogue (known copies are preserved in A-Wn, I-Nc and I-Vnm)
- the 1819 manuscript catalogue of the Arditi collection (I-Nc Archivio storico Ministeriali 9/1074)
- the 1823 manuscript catalogue fragment of the Conservatoire collection (I-Nc F.30 olim S.Dir.6-8)
